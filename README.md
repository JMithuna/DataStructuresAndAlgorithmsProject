# DataStructuresAndAlogrithmsProject
This is a project done based on my knowledge on data structures and algorithms with a classmate for one of my modules.
It is meant to serve as a program that supports a warehouse rack robotic arm that retrieves items stored in the racks using the coordinates and a specific order given.
